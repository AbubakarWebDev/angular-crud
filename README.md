# Angular User Management System with CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins and Docker on AWS

This repository contains the implementation of a User Management System with an integrated CI/CD pipeline using Docker, Jenkins, and deployed on AWS. The system allows you to manage users, including CRUD operations, and automates the deployment process through Jenkins and Docker.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates testing, building, and deployment.
- **Docker Integration**: Containerizes the application for easy deployment.
